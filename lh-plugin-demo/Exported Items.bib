	abstract = {We introduce
              Refinement Reflection
              , a new framework for building {SMT}-based deductive verifiers. The key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the functionâ€™s (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at
              uses
              of the function, the function definition is instantiated in the {SMT} logic in a precise fashion that permits decidable verification. Reflection allows the user to write
              equational proofs
              of programs just by writing other programs using pattern-matching and recursion to perform case-splitting and induction. Thus, via the propositions-as-types principle, we show that reflection permits the
              specification
              of arbitrary functional correctness properties. Finally, we introduce a proof-search algorithm called
              Proof by Logical Evaluation
              that uses techniques from model checking and abstract interpretation, to completely automate equational reasoning. We have implemented reflection in Liquid Haskell and used it to verify that the widely used instances of the Monoid, Applicative, Functor, and Monad typeclasses actually satisfy key algebraic laws required to make the clients safe, and have used reflection to build the first library that actually verifies assumptions about associativity and ordering that are crucial for safe deterministic parallelism.},
